**Example 1:** Only convection - diffusion terms in 1D governed by equation: 

    grad*(rho*Cp*U*T) = grad*(k*grad(T)) + S

Other conditions like the figure below:

The Gaussâ€“Seidel method is an iterative technique for solving a square system of n (n=3) linear equations with unknown x.
Given Ax=B, to find the system of equation x which satisfies this condition.
In more detail, A, x, and b in their components are :

Thus, the general solution of equation Ax = b obeys:
